## First post walk through
This is my first attempt at getting Jeykll working with the minimal mistakes theme.

It didn't take me long to get it up and running. I started by going through the Jekyll step by step tutorial. I then cleared all of that and started over with jekyll new so that I could try out the Minimal Mistakes theme.
